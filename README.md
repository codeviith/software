## About

I am a versatile and driven software engineer with a passion for developing innovative solutions and seeing
projects through from inception to completion. My recent project "DIYeSk8Guide", a full-stack web
application, highlights my commitment to empowering individuals to build their own electric skateboards.
This project showcases my technical proficiency, dedication to hands-on creation, and problem-solving
abilities.

With over two years of experience in web development and design, I possess a robust technical mindset
and excel in the design, implementation, and verification of components. I effectively translate both
functional and technical requirements into comprehensive architectures, optimizing software and website
designs to enhance scalability, reliability, and performance.

As a graduate with a background in both software engineering and podiatric medicine, I bring a unique blend
of technical and mechanical expertise. My experience in technical undertakings has equipped me with the
ability to contribute to innovative solutions. I am passionate about web and software development and I am
eager to collaborate with teams to create meaningful projects. Committed to applying my skills and knowledge, 
I aim to support and enhance the work of my future colleagues and organization by building applications that
make a significant impact.
